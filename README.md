ðŸ“Œ *The dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding user preferences, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving business strategies.* 

## 3) Personal Approach & Tools  

This analysis was conducted using **Google Colab** with **Python**, primarily utilizing the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries for data manipulation and visualization.  

Before diving into the analysis, I created a [logical tree](https://github.com/ngthuylinh3003/PYTHON-PROJECT-Movie-Ticket/blob/f2562c93350c6d2cd6128d9e701370766e71b685/%5B2%5D%20Outline%20of%20Logical%20Tree.png) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem. This helped structure the workflow efficiently and identify key areas to explore.  

At the end of the notebook, a [mind map](https://github.com/ngthuylinh3003/PYTHON-PROJECT-Movie-Ticket/blob/f2562c93350c6d2cd6128d9e701370766e71b685/%5B4%5D%20Insights%20%26%20Recommendations.png) summarizes the findings, including key insights, visualized charts, and actionable recommendations.  

ðŸ“Œ This analysis reflects my personal perspective and approach. **Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback and suggestions!**
